# Spatial-analysis-FFDI-Koala-Habitat

## 📘 Project Description

This project performs a **spatiotemporal analysis of the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI)** across **New South Wales, Australia**, from **2013 to 2023**. It identifies regions under high fire risk over time and evaluates the **spatial overlap between fire risk and FFDI**. Additionally, the project assesses the impact of fire risk on **koala habitats**, using **Python** and **QGIS**.
