# Spatial-analysis-FFDI-Koala-Habitat


## Project Description
This project analyzes the **Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI)** over New South Wales, Australia, from 2013 to 2023. It identifies high fire-risk areas and evaluates their spatial and temporal trends. The analysis also assesses the impact of fire risk on Koala habitats using QGIS and Python.

## Folder Structure

- **Files/**: Contains raster datasets of monthly FFDI values and other spatial data.
- **Codes for analysis/**: Python scripts for processing FFDI data, identifying high-risk pixels, calculating annual fire risk areas in kmÂ², and exporting results.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Install Python packages**:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
   ```bash
